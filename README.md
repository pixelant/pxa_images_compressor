# Images compressor
## Extension automatically optimize images on FE using jpegoptim and OptiPNG. 

### Requirements
* Linux
* Installed [jpegoptim](http://freshmeat.net/projects/jpegoptim/)
* Installed [OptiPNG](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)

### How to use
* Install extension
* Go to extension manager settings and check if you don't get any errors.
* It's possible to disable compression in case you don't need it to compress automatically.
* You can change compress level. Bigger value => smaller file, but loss of quality.
